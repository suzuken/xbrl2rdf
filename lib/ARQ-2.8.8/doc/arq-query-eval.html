        ARQ - Extending Query Execution</h1>
    <p>
        This page describes the mechanisms that can be used to extend and modify 
		query execution within ARQ. Through these mechanisms, ARQ can be used to query different graph implementations and to provide different query evaluation and optimization
        strategies for particular circumstances.&nbsp; These mechanisms are used by <a href="http://openjena.org/SDB/">
            SDB</a> and <a href="http://openjena.org/TDB/">TDB</a>.</p>
    <p>
        ARQ can be <a href="extension.html">extended in various
            ways</a> to incorporate custom code into a query. <a href="extension.html#valueFunctions">Custom filter functions</a>
        and <a href="extension.html#propertyFunctions">property functions</a> provide ways
        to add application specific code. The <a href="lucene-arq.html">free text search</a>
        capabilities, using Apache Lucene, are provided via a property function. Custom
        filter functions and property functions should be used where possible.</p>
	<p>
        Jena itself can be extended by providing a new implementation of the
		<code>Graph</code> interface. This can be used to encapsulate specific 
		specialised storage and also for wrapping non-RDF sources to look like 
		RDF. Theer is a common implementation framework provided by <code>
		GraphBase</code> so only one operation, the <code>find</code> method, 
		needs to be written for a read-only data source. Basic find works well 
		is many cases, and the whole Jena API will be able to use the extension.&nbsp; 
		For higher SPARQL performance, ARQ can be extended at the
		<a href="#StageGenerator">basic graph matching</a> or
		<a href="#OpExecutor">algebra level</a>.</p>
    <p>
        Applications writers who extend ARQ at the query execution level should be prepared
        to work with the source code for ARQ for specific details and for finding code to
        reuse. Some example can be found in the <code>src-examples</code> 
		directory in the ARQ download.</p>

        Overview of ARQ Query Processing</h2>
    <p>
        The sequence of actions performed by ARQ to perform a query are parsing, algebra
        generation, execution building, high-level optimization, low-level optimization
        and finally evaluation. It is not usual to modify the parsing step nor 
		the conversion from the parse tree to the algebra form, which is a fixed 
		algorithm defined by the SPARQL standard. Extensions can modify the algebra form 
		by transforming it from one algebra expression to another, including 
		introducing new operators. See also the documentation
        on <a href="algebra.html">working with the SPARQL algebra in ARQ</a> including building
        algebra expressions programmatically, rather than obtaining them from a query string.</p>
    <h3>
        Parsing</h3>
    <p>
        The parsing step turns a query string into a <code>Query</code> object. The class 
		<code>Query</code> reprensets the abstract syntax tree
        (AST) for the query and provides methods to create the AST, primarily for 
		use by the parser.
        The query object also provides methods to serialize the query to a string. Because
        this is the AST, the string produced is very close to the original query with the
        same syntactic elements, but without comments, and formatted with a whitespace for readability.
        It is not usually the best way to build a query programmatically and the AST is
        not normally an extension point.
    </p>
    <p>
        The query object can be used many times. It is not modified once created, and in
        particular it is not modified by query execution.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Algebra generation</h3>
    <p>
        ARQ generates the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/#sparqlQuery">SPARQL
            algebra</a> expression for the query. After this a number of transformations
        can be applied (for example, identification of property functions) but the first
        step is the application of the algorithm in the SPARQL specification for translating
        a SPARQL query string, as held in a <code>Query</code> object into a SPARQL algebra
        expression. This includes the process of removing joins involving the identity pattern
        (the empty graph pattern).</p>
    <p>
        For example, the query:</p>
    <pre class="box">PREFIX foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt;
SELECT ?name ?mbox ?nick
WHERE  { ?x foaf:name  ?name ;
            foaf:mbox  ?mbox .
         OPTIONAL { ?x  foaf:nick  ?nick }
       }</pre>
    <p>
        becomes</p>
    <pre class="box">
(prefix ((foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt;))
  (project (?name ?mbox ?nick)
    (leftjoin
      (bgp
        (triple ?x foaf:name ?name)
        (triple ?x foaf:mbox ?mbox)
      )
      (bgp (triple ?x foaf:nick ?nick)
      )
    )))</pre>
    <p>
        using the <a href="http://openjena.org/wiki/SSE">SSE syntax</a> to write out
        the internal datastructure for the algebra.</p>
    <p>
        The <a href="http://www.sparql.org/validator.html">online SPARQL validator</a> at
        <a href="http://sparql.org/">sparql.org</a> can be used to see the algebra expression
        for a SPARQL query.</p>
    <h3>
        High-Level Optimization and Transformations</h3>
    <p>
        There is a collection of transformations that can be applied to the algebra, such
        as replacing equality filters with a more efficient graph pattern and an assignment.
        When extending ARQ, a query processor for a custom storage layout can choose which
        optimizations are appropriate and can also provide its own algebra transformations.</p>
    <p>
        A transform is code that converts an algebra operation into other algebra operations.
        It is applied using the <code>Transformer</code> class:</p>
    <pre class="box">Op op = ... ;
Transform someTransform = ... ;
op = Transformer.transform(someTransform, op) ;</pre>
    <p>
        The <code>Transformer</code> class applies the transform to each operation in the
        algebra expression tree. <code>Transform</code> itself is an interface, with one
        method signature for each operation type, returning a replacement for the operator 
		instance it
        is called on.</p>
    <p>
        One such transformation is to turn a SPARQL algebra expression involving
        named graphs and triples into one using quads. This transformation is 
		performed by a call to <code>Algebra.toQuadForm</code>.</p>
	<p>
        Transformations proceed from the bottom of the expression tree to the 
		top. Algebra expressions are best treated as immutable so a change made 
		in one part of the tree should result in a copy of the tree above it.&nbsp; 
		This is automated by the&nbsp; <code>TransformCopy</code> class which is 
		the commonly used base class for writing transforms. The other helper 
		base class is <code>TransformBase,</code> which provides the identify 
		operation (returns the node supplied) for each transform operation.</p>
	<p>
        Operations can be printed out in <a href="http://openjena.org/wiki/SSE">SSE</a>
        syntax.&nbsp; The Java <code>toString</code> method is overridden to provide pretty
        printing and the static methods in <code>WriterOp</code> provide output to various
        output objects like <code>java.io.OutputStream</code>.</p>
    <h3>
        Low-Level Optimization and Evaluation</h3>
    <p>
        The step of evaluating a query is the process of executing the algebra expression,
        as modified by any transformations applied, to yield a stream of pattern solutions.
        Low-level optimizations include choosing the order in which to evaluate basic graph
        patterns. These are the responsibility of the custom storage layer. Low-level optimization
        can be carried out dynamically as part of evaluation.</p>
    <p>
        Internally, ARQ uses iterators extensively. Where possible, evaluation of an operation
        is achieved by feeding the stream of results from the previous stage into the evaluation.
        A common pattern is to take each intermediate result one at a time (use <code>QueryIterRepeatApply</code>
        to be called for each binding) , substituting the variables of pattern with those
        in the incoming binding, and evaluating to a query iterator of all results for this
        incoming row. The result can be the empty iterator (one that always 
		returns false for <code>hasNext</code>). It is also common to not have
        to touch the incoming stream at all but merely to pass it to sub-operations.</p>
    <h3>
        Query Engines and Query Engine Factories</h3>
    <p>
        The steps from algebra generation to query evaluation are carried out when a query
        is executed via the <code>QueryExecution.execSelect</code> or other <code>QueryExecution</code>
        exec operation. It is possible to carry out storage-specific operations when the
        query execution is created. A query engine works in conjunction with a <code>
		QueryExecution</code> created by the <code>QueryExecutionFactory</code> 
		to provide the evaluation of a query pattern. <code>QueryExecutionBase</code> 
		provides all the machinery for the different result types and does not 
		need to be modified by extensions to query execution.</p>
	<p>
        ARQ provides three query engine factories; the main query engine factory, one for
        a reference query engine and one to remotely execute a query. SDB and TDB provide
        their own query engine factories which they register during sub-system initialization.
        Both extend the main query engine described below.</p>
    <p>
        The reference query engine is a direct top-down evaluation of the expression. It's
        purpose is to be simple so it can be easily verified and checked then its results
        used to check more complicated processing in the main engine and other implementations.
        All arguments to each operator are fully evaluated to produce intermediate in-memory
        tables then a simple implementation of the operator is called to calculate 
		the results. It does not scale and
        does not perform any optimizations. It is intended to be clear and simple; it is
        not designed to be efficient.
    </p>
    <p>
        Query engines are chosen by referring to the registry of query engine factories.</p>
    <pre class="box">public interface QueryEngineFactory
{
    public boolean accept(Query query, DatasetGraph dataset, Context context) ;
    public Plan create(Query query, DatasetGraph dataset, Binding inputBinding, Context context) ;
    
    public boolean accept(Op op, DatasetGraph dataset, Context context) ;
    public Plan create(Op op, DatasetGraph dataset, Binding inputBinding, Context context) ;
}</pre>
    <p>
        When the query execution factory is given a dataset and query, the query execution
        factory tries each registered engine factory in turn calling the <code>accept</code>
        method (for query of algebra depending on how it was presented). The registry is
        kept in reverse registration order - the most recently registered query engine factory
        is tried first. The first query engine factor to return true is chosen and no further
        engine factories are checked.</p>
    <p>
        When a query engine factory is chosen, the <code>create</code> method is called
        to return a <code>Plan</code> object for the execution. The main operation of the
        plan interface is to get the <code>QueryIterator</code> for the query.</p>
    <p>
        See the example in <code>src-examples/arq.examples.engine.MyQueryEngine</code>.</p>
    <h2 id="mainQueryEngine">
        The Main Query Engine</h2>
    <p>
        The main query engine can execute any query. It contains a number of basic graph
        pattern matching implementations including one that uses the <code>Graph.find</code>
        operation so it can work with any implementation of the Jena Graph SPI. The main
        query engine works with general purpose datasets but not quad stores directly; it
        evaluates patterns on each graph in turn.
        The main query engine includes optimizations for the standard Jena implementation
        of in-memory graphs.</p>
    <p>
        High-level optimization is performed by a sequence of transformations. This set of
        optimizations is evolving. A custom implementation of a query engine can reuse some
        or all of these transformations (see <code>Algebra.optimize</code> which is the
        set of transforms used by the main query engine).</p>
    <p>
        The main query engine is a streaming engine. It evaluates expressions as the client
        consumes each query solution.
        After preparing the execution by creating the initial conditions (a partial solution
        of one row and no bound variables or any initial bindings of variables), the main
        query engine calls 
        <code>QC.execute</code> which is the algorithm to execute a query. Any extension
        that wished to reuse some of the main query engine by providing it's own <code>OpExecutor</code>
        must call this method to evaluate a sub-operation.</p>
    <p>
        <code>QC.execute</code> finds the currently active <code>OpExecutor</code> factory,
        creates an <code>OpExecutor</code> object and invokes it to evaluate one algebra
        operation.</p>
    <p>
        There are two points of extension for the main query engine:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stage generators, for evaluating basic graph patterns and reusing the rest of the
            engine.</li>
        <li><code>OpExecutor</code> to execute any algebra operator specially.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The standard <code>OpExecutor</code> invokes the stage generator mechanism to match
        a basic graph pattern.</p>
	<h2 id="StageGenerator">
        Graph matching and a custom StageGenerator</h2>
    <p>
        The correct point to hook into ARQ for just extending basic graph pattern matching
        (BGPs) is to provide a custom <code>StageGenerator</code>.&nbsp; (To hook into filtered
        basic graph patterns, the extension will need to provide it's own <code>OpExecutor</code>
        factory). The advantage of the <code>StageGenerator</code> mechanism, as compared
        to the more general <code>OpExecutor</code> described below, is that it more self-contained
        and requires less detail about the internal evaluation of the other SPARQL algebra
        operators.&nbsp; This extension point corresponds to section 12.6 &quot;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/#sparqlBGPExtend">Extending
            SPARQL Basic Graph Matching</a>&quot;.</p>
    <p>
        Below is the default code to match a BGP from <code>OpExecutor.execute(OpBGP, QueryIterator)</code>.
        It merely calls fixed code in the <code>StageBuilder</code> class.The input is a stream of results from earlier stages. The execution must return
        a query iterator that is all the possible ways to match the basic graph pattern
        for each of the inputs in turn. Order of results does not matter.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <pre class="box">protected QueryIterator execute(OpBGP opBGP, QueryIterator input)
{
    BasicPattern pattern = opBGP.getPattern() ;
    return StageBuilder.execute(pattern, input, execCxt) ;
}</pre>
    <p>
        The <code>StageBuilder</code> looks for the stage generator by accessing the context
        for the execution:</p>
    <pre class="box">StageGenerator stageGenerator = (StageGenerator)context.get(ARQ.stageGenerator) ;</pre>
	<p>where the context is the global context and any query execution specific 
	additions together with various execution control elements.</p>
    <p>
        A <code>StageGenerator</code> is an implementation of:</p>
    <pre class="box">
    public interface StageGenerator
    {
        public QueryIterator execute(BasicPattern pattern, 
                                     QueryIterator input,
                                     ExecutionContext execCxt) ;
    }
</pre>
    <h3>
        Setting the Stage Generator</h3>
    <p>
        An extension stage generator can be registered on a per-query execution basis or
        (more usually) in the global context.</p>
    <pre class="box">
    StageBuilder.setGenerator(Context, StageGenerator)    </pre>
    <p>
        The global context can be obtained by a call to <code>ARQ.getContext()</code></p>
    <pre class="box">    StageBuilder.setGenerator(<code>ARQ.getContext()</code>, myStageGenerator) ;</pre>
    <p>
        In order to allow an extensions to still permit other graphs to be used, stage generators
        are usually chained, with each new custom one passing the execution request up the
        chain if the request is not supported by this custom stage generator.</p>
    <pre class="box">public class MyStageGenerator implements StageGenerator
{
    StageGenerator above = null ;
    
    public MyStageGenerator (StageGenerator original)
    { above = original ; }
    
    @Override
    public QueryIterator execute(BasicPattern pattern, QueryIterator input, ExecutionContext execCxt)
    {
        Graph g = execCxt.getActiveGraph() ;
        // Test to see if this is a graph we support.  
        if ( ! ( g instanceof MySpecialGraphClass ) )
            // Not us - bounce up the StageGenerator chain
            return above.execute(pattern, input, execCxt) ;
        MySpecialGraphClass graph = (MySpecialGraphClass )g ;
        // Create a QueryIterator for this request
     ... 
  </pre>
    <p>
        This is registered by setting the global context (<code>StageBuilder</code> has
        a convenience operation to do this):</p>
    <pre class="box">
  // Get the standard one. 
  StageGenerator orig = (StageGenerator)ARQ.getContext().get(ARQ.stageGenerator) ;
  // Create a new one 
  StageGenerator myStageGenerator= new MyStageGenerator(orig) ;
  // Register it
  StageBuilder.setGenerator(<code>ARQ.getContext()</code>, myStageGenerator) ;
   </pre>
    <p id="OpExecutor">
        Example: <code>src-examples/arq.examples.bgpmatching</code>.</p>
    <h2>
        OpExecutor</h2>
    <p>
        A <code>StageGenerator</code> provides matching for a basic graph pattern. If an
        extension wishes to take responsibility for more of the evaluation then it needs
        to work with <code>OpExecutor</code>. This includes evaluation of filtered basic
        graph patterns.</p>
    <p>
        An example query using a filter:</p>
    <pre class="box">PREFIX  dc:   &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt;
PREFIX  books: &lt;http://example.org/book/&gt;

SELECT  *
WHERE
  { ?book  dc:title  ?title .
    FILTER regex(?title, &quot;Paddington&quot;)
  }</pre>
    <p>
        &nbsp;results in the algebra expression for the pattern:</p>
    <pre class="box">    (filter (regex ?title &quot;Paddington&quot;)
        (bgp (triple ?book dc:title ?title)
        ))</pre>
    <p>
        showing that the filter is being applied to the results of a basic graph pattern
        matching.</p>
    <p>
        Note: this is not the way to provide custom filter operations.&nbsp; See the documentation
        for <a href="extension.html#valueFunctions">application-provided filter functions</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each step of evaluation in the main query engine is performed by a <code>OpExecutor</code>
        and a new one is created from a factory at each step.&nbsp; The factory is registered
        in the execution context. The implementation of a specialized <code>OpExecutor</code>
        can inherit from the standard one and override only those algebra operators it wishes
        to deal with, including inspecting the execution and choosing to passing up to the
        super-class based on the details of the operation.&nbsp; From the query above, only
        regex filters might be specially handled.</p>
    <p>
        Registering an <code>OpExecutorFactory</code>:</p>
    <pre class="box">OpExecutorFactory customExecutorFactory = new MyOpExecutorFactory(...) ;
QC.setFactory(ARQ.getCOntext(), customExecutorFactory) ;</pre>
    <p>
        QC is a point of indirection that chooses the execution process at each stage in
        a query so if the custom execution wishes to evaluate an algebra operation within
        another operation, it shoudl call <code>QC.execute</code>. Be careful not to loop endlessly
        if the operation is itself handled by the custom evaluator. This can be done by
        swapping in a different <code>OpExecutorFactory</code>.</p>
    <pre class="box">   // Execute an operation with a different OpExecution Factory

   // New context.
   ExecutionContext ec2 = new ExecutionContext(execCxt) ;
   ec2.setExecutor(plainFactory) ;

   QueryIterator qIter = QC.execute(op, input, ec2) ;</pre>
    <pre class="box">   private static OpExecutorFactory plainFactory = 
      new OpExecutorFactory()
      {
         @Override
         public OpExecutor create(ExecutionContext execCxt)
         {
             // The default OpExecutor of ARQ.
             return new OpExecutor(execCxt) ;
         }
      } ;</pre>
    <h2 id="quads">
        Quads</h2>
    <p>
        If a custom extension provides named graphs, then it may be useful to execute the
        quad form of the query. This is done by writing a custom query engine and overriding
        <code>QueryEngineMain.modifyOp</code>:
    </p>
    <pre class="box">  @Override
  protected Op modifyOp(Op op)
  { 
     // Cope with initial bindings.
     op = Substitute.substitute(op, initialInput) ;
     // Use standard optimizations.
     op = super.modifyOp(op) ;			
     // Turn into quad form.
     op = Algebra.toQuadForm(op) ;
     return op ;
  }</pre>
    <p>
        The extension may need to provide its own dataset implementation so that it can
        detect when queries are directed to its named graph storage. <a href="http://openjena.org/SDB">
            SDB</a> and <a href="http://openjena.org/TDB">TDB</a> are examples of this.</p>
    <h2 id="mixedDatasets">
        Mixed Graph Implementation Datasets</h2>
    <p>
        The dataset implementation used in normal operation does not work on quads but instead
        can provide a dataset with a collection of graphs each from different implementation
        sub-systems. In-memory graphs can be mixed with database backed graphs as well as
        custom storage systems. Query execution proceeds per-graph so that an custom <code>OpExecutor</code>
        will need to test the graph to work with to make sure it is of the right class.
        The pattern in the <code>StageGenerator</code> extension point is an example of
        design pattern in that situation.</p>
    <h2 id="CustomQueryEngines">
        Custom Query Engines</h2>
    <p>
        A custom query engine enables an extension to choose which datasets it wishes to
        handle. It also allows the extension to intercept query execution during the setup
        of the execution so it can modify the algebra expression, introduce it's own algebra
        extensions, choose which high-level optimizations to apply and also transform to
        the expression into quad form. Execution can proceed with the normal algorithm or
        a custom <code>OpExecutor</code> or a custom Stage Generator or a combination of
        all three extension mechanism.</p>

        Only a small, skeleton custom query engine is needed to intercept the initial setup.
        See the example in <code>src-examples/arq.examples.engine.MyQueryEngine</code>.</p>

        While it is possible to replace the entire process of query evaluation, this is
        a substantial endeavour. <code>QueryExecutionBase</code> provides the machinery
        for result presentation (<code>SELECT</code>, <code>CONSTRUCT</code>, 
		<code>DESCRIBE</code>, <code>ASK</code>), leaving the work of
        pattern evaluation to the custom query engine. <code>QueryExecutionFactory</code>
        assumes that <code>QueryExecutionBase</code> will be used.</p>

    <p>
        New operators can be added to the algebra using the <code>OpExt</code> class as
        the super-class of the new operator. They can be inserted into the expression to
        be evaluated using a custom query engine to intercept evaluation initialization.&nbsp;
        When evaluation of a query requires the evaluation of a sub-class of <code>OpExt</code>,
        the <code>eval</code> method is called. SDB uses this to introduce an operator that
        is implemented in SQL.</p>
