<h1>ARQ - Sub Queries</h1>
<p>ARQ includes support for nested SELECTs.</p>

<p>This involves is syntactic extension and is available if the query is parsed 
with language <code>Syntax.syntaxARQ</code>.</p>
<h2>Nested SELECT</h2>
<p>A SELECT query can be placed inside a graph pattern to produce a table that 
is used within the outer query. A nested SELECT statement is enclosed in {} and 
is the only element in that group.</p>
<p>Example: find toys with more than five orders:</p>
<pre class="box">PREFIX : &lt;http://example/&gt;
SELECT ?x
{ 
  ?x a :Toy .
  { SELECT ?x ( count(?order) as ?q ) { ?x :order ?order } GROUP BY ?x }
  FILTER ( ?q &gt; 5 )
}</pre>
