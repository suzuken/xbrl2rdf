TurtleStd/test-28.ttl is broken.

It looses the precision.
test-28.out has corrected answers.

TurtleStd/test-29.ttl has a silly URI contains 
\t, \r, \n, \\, bad % and [] which are
illegal and contradicts the resolve URI references rule.
Also has a bad fragment and bad query.

# Tests fixed.
