			Sesame is an open source Java framework for storage and querying of
			RDF data. The framework is fully extensible and configurable with
			respect to storage mechanisms, inferencers, RDF file formats, query
			result formats and query languages. Sesame offers a JBDC-like user
			API, streamlined system APIs and a RESTful HTTP interface supporting
			the SPARQL Protocol for RDF.
		</p><p>
			Of course, a framework isn't very useful without implementations of
			the various APIs. Out of the box, Sesame supports SPARQL and SeRQL
			querying, a memory-based and a disk-based RDF store and RDF Schema
			inferencers. It also supports most popular RDF file formats and
			query result formats. Various extensions are available or are being
			worked at elsewhere.
		</p><p>
			Originally, Sesame was developed by
			<a href="http://www.aduna-software.com/" target="_top">Aduna</a> (then
			known as Aidministrator) as a research prototype for the hugely
			successful EU research project
			<a href="http://www.ontoknowledge.org/" target="_top">On-To-Knowledge</a>.
			When this work ended in 2001, Aduna continued the development in
			cooperation with <a href="http://www.nlnet.nl/" target="_top">NLnet Foundation</a>,
			developers from <a href="" target="_top">Ontotext</a>, and a number of volunteer developers who
			contribute ideas, bug reports and fixes.
		</p><p>
			Sesame is currently developed as a community project, with Aduna as
			the project leader. Community support is available from
			<a href="http://www.openrdf.org/" target="_top">www.openrdf.org</a>. Aduna
			also offers commercial support and consultency services, feel free
			to <a href="http://www.aduna-software.com/contact/" target="_top">contact
				us</a> for more information.

			For those who have previously worked with Sesame 1.x: Sesame 2 is an
			important step forward from the Sesame 1.x series, building on the
			feedback that has been gathered during the past years. A lot of
			improvements have been made to various APIs as well as the framework
			as a whole.
		</p><p>
			Unfortunately, because of all the changes to APIs and the like,
			<span class="emphasis"><em>Sesame 2 is not backwards compatible with earlier
				releases</em></span>. Therefore, we suggest you read through this
			user guide before starting to port any applications to Sesame 2.
		</p><p>
			So what's new in Sesame 2? Well, in short:
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
				Sesame 2 is completely targeted at Java 5. All APIs use
				Java 5 features such as typed collections and iterators.
			</li><li>
				Revised Repository API that is much more targeted at
				the use of Sesame as a library.
			</li><li>
				Support for context/provenance, allowing you to keep track
				of individual RDF data units (like files, for instance).
			</li><li>
				Proper transaction/rollback support.
			</li><li>
				A REST-ful HTTP protocol that includes support for the
				<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-protocol/" target="_top">SPARQL protocol</a> and
				<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-XMLres/" target="_top">SPARQL Query Results XML Format</a>,
				which are currently both Proposed Recommendations from the W3C.
			</li><li>
				Support for the
				<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/" target="_top">SPARQL Query Language</a>.
			</li></ul></div><p>
			A lot of these new features will be covered in the next chapters.
